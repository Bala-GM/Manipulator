give me the code to breakdown it
ChatGPT
Sure, here's a Python function to break down the folder name into its components:

python
Copy code
def breakdown_folder_name(folder_name):
    parts = folder_name.split(';')
    breakdown = {
        'Identifier': parts[0],
        'Version': parts[1],
        'Position': parts[2],
        'Secondary Identifier': parts[3],
        'Production Stage': parts[4],
        'Setup Details': parts[5]
    }
    return breakdown

# Example folder name
folder_name = "ECH3ACE00019 T&B;B1;Bottom;ECH3ACE00019 T;[Bottom] Line1;Original setup"

# Break down the folder name
folder_breakdown = breakdown_folder_name(folder_name)

# Print the breakdown
for key, value in folder_breakdown.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
This code defines a function breakdown_folder_name that takes a folder name as input and returns a dictionary with the breakdown of its components. You can then use this function to analyze any folder name you provide.
